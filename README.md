# parking-api

## Build/Run 

* A deployable war file can be created in the target directory using the standard Maven command (`mvn package`) and then deployed to any compatible servlet container. 
* Alternatively, the application can be run using the included spring-boot-starter-tomcat dependency using the Maven command : `mvn spring-boot:run`
* Application can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/api/pairking

## Test
* All test cases are located in src/test/java and can be run using the standard maven command (`mvn test`) in the project's root directory or with a run configuration of you favorite IDE.
* I have included the exported Postman collection file (ParkingAPI.postman_collection.json) in the projects root directory and this can be used for any integration testing. 

## Logging/Documentation 
* Application logging can be enabled by setting the logging level to DEBUG of the com.abuob.parking logger in the projects log4j2.yaml file
* I have included the Springfox Swagger 2 dependencies in the projects pom.xml file and have made some basic annotations in ParkingController.java. This can be accessed in the browser at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

## Design/Notes
* To support the possibility of multiple different timezones in the input JSON, the method `public static List<RateDTO> convertToRateDTO(List<ParkingRateCreateRequest> parkingRateCreateRequestList)` in `ParkingRateUtil.java` stores a representative of each day of the week for each timezone in the `Map<String, Map<DayOfWeekEnum, ZonedDateTime>>` data structure where the key string is the timezone. This is done to not have to do the map computation multiple times for each timezone in the input.  
* The InMemoryParkingRateRepository stores the tuples `(day of week, hour of day, price)` in the data structure `Map<DayOfWeekEnum, Map<Integer, Integer>> ` in UTC and doesnâ€™t take DST into account. I would solve this using the structure `Map<String, Map<DayOfWeekEnum, Map<Integer, Integer>> >` where the key String is the timezone and not doing conversion to UTC before adding to the repository. The tuple would then become: `(timezone, day of week, hour of day, price)`
